# Beep Boop Bot

Beep Boop Bot is an education game aimed at children to teach the basis of programming and logic. The player is presented with a robot (our friend B3) who must navigate through a course of obstacles to reach the exit. The player queues a series of commands, which are executed to control the movment of B3.

## Data Model

### B3
B3 is represented as an object in the store:
robot = {
	direction: intger: 0 = North, 90 = East, 180 = South, 270 = West
	isOnBox: Boolean
	positionX: integer 0 - 4
	positionY: integer 0 - 4
}

### The board
The board is represented as an array of arrays in the store. Each array represents a row of tiles. Each array element represents a tile.
0 = empty square
1 = exit
2 = box on square

eg: board = [
	[0,0,2,0,0]
	[0,0,0,0,0]
	[0,2,0,0,0]
	[0,0,0,0,0]
	[0,0,0,2,1]
]

All 10 boards are stored in a data.json object, which are required in. Level one = levels.one etc.

### Actions
The command pane and nav bar have a number of assocaited components that can dispatch actions.
Go: GO_BUTTON
Stop: STOP_BUTTON
Clear: CLEAR_QUEUE
Add forward command: ADD_FORWARD
Add rotate left command: ADD_LEFT
Add rotate right command: ADD_RIGHT
Add jump command: ADD_JUMP
Select level: SELECT_LEVEL (action.level = 'one' - 'ten')

## Information for the team

Each team member is to install standardJS (npm i standard -g) and standard-format (npm i standard-format -g).
Run standard (linter) with 'standard'. It checks all of the files in your current dir for formatting and linting problems and prints a list of problems. Fix the problems before pushing to github. You can also run 'standard-format -w', which usually automatically fixes most of the errors.

Sublime and Atom packages available. See https://github.com/feross/standard and https://www.npmjs.com/package/standard-format for details. Ask Miles if you have installation problems.

We are using TravisCI to check for errors before merging with master.
